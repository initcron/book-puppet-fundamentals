#  Chapter 06  :  Enhancing Classes with Parameters
Usage of variables and templates was the beginning of separating code vs data, and we now have a dynamic module created.  However, we still are defining the properties inside the classes, making the module specific to our organization and un sharable. In this session we are going to take the data out of the modules, and move it to node definitions, making the modules truly sharable. While doing so, we will learn about Parameterized Classes as well as a special design pattern created to store the parameters. We will also learn about the class inheritance, when to use it and how it works. Finally, we would update the way we have been calling classes from the node definitions and start passing parameters.
