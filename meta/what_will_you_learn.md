In Chapter 1 we are going to get introduced to what puppet is, when to use its, Puppet features, and case studies.

Chapter 2 we will start setting up local learning environment with Virtualbox  and vagrant. We will use this environment to setup Puppet infrastructure, and test the code that we create in consequent chapters.

Chapter 3 is where we learn how to install Puppet, setup Master and Agent, setup communication between those and have the nodes ready to be managed and configured with Puppet.

Chapter 4 is where we start diving into writing infrastructure as a code. We learn about the building blocks of puppet i.e. resource, how they are related to provides, and start writing manifests.  

With Chapter 5 we start building modular, reusable and shareable code blocks by organizing manifests inside modules and adding supporting entities eg. files.
